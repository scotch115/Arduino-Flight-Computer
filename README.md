# BME280 and Arduino Nano Weather Station

This code outlines how to read and display the serial data from the Adafruit BME280 Temperature Sensor on an Arduino Nano, and display data on an I2C LCD. (In this particular case, a 16x2 LCD)

### Update
This prototype has been combined with an Arduino ProMicro and LISD3H accelerometer sending data over serial pins. Next phase is to validate data and process sensor measurements faster by adjusting loop code.
