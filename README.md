# BME280 and Arduino Nano Weather Station

This code outlines how to read and display the serial data from the Adafruit BME280 Temperature Sensor on an Arduino Nano, and display data on an I2C LCD. (In this particular case, a 16x2 LCD)


This is a prototype for a future project which will incorporate this weather station alongside an accelerometer to work as the telemetry for a model rocket.
